<h2>Practical Exam</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/zak-soussi/Data-Scientist-Professional-Certificate/blob/main/Practical%20Exam.ipynb">Real-world Application with Tasty Bytes</a>
<p>Tasty Bytes offers monthly meal plans for a healthy, balanced diet. The project is set to revolutionize the recipe selection process for the homepage. The mission is to predict recipe popularity to optimize website traffic and boost subscriptions. I was tasked with creating a model that precisely predicts high-traffic recipes, aiming for an impressive 80% precision score as the optimization metric and 70% for the recall score as the satisficing metric. This strategic approach is crucial to prevent the negative impact on website traffic caused by mistakenly predicting a recipe as high-traffic when it isn't.<br>
The project involves meticulous data analysis, well-documented code, and a comprehensive report, culminating in a dynamic presentation for the product team.<br>
