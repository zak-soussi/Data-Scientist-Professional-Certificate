<h2>Exams Results</h2>

<a href=""><h3>DS101: Mastery in Statistics and Data Analytics</h3></a>
<a href=""><h3>DS201: Advanced Data Management , SQL and Modeling Skills</h3></a>

<h2>Practical Exam</h2>

<a href=""><h3>Real-world Application with Tasty Bytes</h3></a>
<p>Tasty Bytes offers monthly meal plans for a healthy, balanced diet. The project is set to revolutionize the recipe selection process for the homepage. The mission is to predict recipe popularity to optimize website traffic and boost subscriptions. I was tasked with creating a model that precisely predicts high-traffic recipes, aiming for an impressive 80% precision score as the optimization metric and 70% for the recall score as the satisficing metric.<br> This strategic approach is crucial to prevent the negative impact on website traffic caused by mistakenly predicting a recipe as high-traffic when it isn't.
The project involves meticulous data analysis, well-documented code, and a comprehensive report, culminating in a dynamic presentation for the product team.
In the notebook , you can discover a comprehensive breakdown of my work and documentation for each key section:</p>
